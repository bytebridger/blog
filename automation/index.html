      <p>Automation will help us get things done quickly and efficiently, but I have to say - 
I have never read anything more creative when it comes to scripting. This is a true
story that was told by Nihad Abbasov [Narkoz] based on his experience with one of his
co-worker's scripts.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<blockquote>
<p>xxx: OK, so, our build engineer has left for another company. The dude was literally living inside the terminal. You know, that type of a guy who loves Vim, creates diagrams in Dot and writes wiki-posts in Markdown... If something - anything - requires more than 90 seconds of his time, he writes a script to automate that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>xxx: So we're sitting here, looking through his, uhm, &quot;legacy&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>xxx: You're gonna love this</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>xxx: <a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/smack-my-bitch-up.sh"><code>smack-my-bitch-up.sh</code></a> - sends a text message &quot;late at work&quot; to his wife (apparently). Automatically picks reasons from an array of strings, randomly. Runs inside a cron-job. The job fires if there are active SSH-sessions on the server after 9pm with his login.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>xxx: <a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/kumar-asshole.sh"><code>kumar-asshole.sh</code></a> - scans the inbox for emails from &quot;Kumar&quot; (a DBA at our clients). Looks for keywords like &quot;help&quot;, &quot;trouble&quot;, &quot;sorry&quot; etc. If keywords are found - the script SSHes into the clients server and rolls back the staging database to the latest backup. Then sends a reply &quot;no worries mate, be careful next time&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>xxx: <a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/hangover.sh"><code>hangover.sh</code></a> - another cron-job that is set to specific dates. Sends automated emails like &quot;not feeling well/gonna work from home&quot; etc. Adds a random &quot;reason&quot; from another predefined array of strings. Fires if there are no interactive sessions on the server at 8:45am.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>xxx: (and the oscar goes to) <a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/fucking-coffee.sh"><code>fucking-coffee.sh</code></a> - this one waits exactly 17 seconds (!), then opens a telnet session to our coffee-machine (we had no frikin idea the coffee machine is on the network, runs linux and has a TCP socket up and running) and sends something like <code>sys brew</code>. Turns out this thing starts brewing a mid-sized half-caf latte and waits another 24 (!) seconds before pouring it into a cup. The timing is exactly how long it takes to walk to the machine from the dudes desk.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>xxx: holy sh*t I'm keeping those</p>
